  * I was trying to detect my talisman wallet in my app, all the code seemed very correct but it was not detecting 
    my wallet extension, i was on this issue for four hours and i couldnt solve it, i was sorely discouraged, as 
    i continued in the tutorial the tutor had the same issue and all he did was to change the address on the 
    address bar from http://127.0.0.1:5173/ to http://localhost:5173/. I felt so foolish(10/4/2023).
